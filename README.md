A Banach space mixed formulation for the fully dynamic Navierâ€“Stokesâ€“Biot coupled problem, authored by: Sergio Caucao, Aashi Dalal, Ivan Yotov.

Abstract: We introduce and analyse a mixed formulation for the coupled problem arising in the interaction
 between a free fluid and a poroelastic medium. The flows in the free fluid and poroelastic regions
 are governed by the Navierâ€“Stokes and Biot equations, respectively, and the transmission conditions
 are given by mass conservation, balance of stresses, and the Beaversâ€“Josephâ€“Saffman law. We ap
ply dual-mixed formulations in both Navierâ€“Stokes and Darcy equations, where the symmetry of the
 Navierâ€“Stokes pseudostress tensor is imposed in a weak sense and a displacement-based formulation for
 elasticity equation. In turn, since the transmission conditions are essential in the mixed formulation,
 they are imposed weakly by introducing the traces of the fluid velocity and the poroelastic medium
 pressure on the interface as the associated Lagrange multipliers. The existence and uniqueness of a
 solution are established for the continuous weak formulation and the semi-discrete continuous-in-time
 formulation with nonmatching grids within a Banach space framework. The proof relies on classical
 results for nonlinear monotone operators, complemented by a regularization technique and the Banach
 fixed-point method, under small data assumptions. We then present error analysis with correspond
ing rates of convergence for semidiscrete continuous-in-time formulation. Numerical experiments are
 presented to verify the theoretical rates of convergence and to illustrate the methodâ€™s performance in
 applications involving flow through a filter.
